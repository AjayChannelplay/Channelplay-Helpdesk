The tickets shown in my dashboard are not properly synced with the emails in my mailbox (Gmail). Here's what I mean:

Mismatch in Email Timing:
The emails that arrive in Gmail are processed by my system using polling (or a webhook), and they appear in the dashboard as tickets. However, the timestamp shown on the dashboard is the time when the system fetched the email, not the original time when the email was actually sent or received in Gmail.

Expected Behavior:
I want the ticket in the dashboard to reflect the actual send/receive time of the email (as shown in Gmail), not the time when my backend fetched it.

Would you like help adjusting your backend logic so it fetches and uses the correct email timestamp from Gmail (like the Date header in the email)?

yes I am using the smpt in my dashboard

Thanks! Since you mentioned you're using SMTP, it's important to clarify that:

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is only for sending emails — not for receiving emails.

So if you're using SMTP alone, your system cannot directly read or sync incoming emails from Gmail. You would need to use one of the receiving protocols, such as:

✅ Correct Way to Read Incoming Emails:
To properly sync incoming emails (from Gmail) and get their actual send time, you need to use one of the following:

Protocol	Purpose	How it helps
IMAP	Reads emails from the Gmail mailbox	Allows you to access full email data, including original send time (Date header), subject, sender, body, etc.
Gmail API	Google's REST API for Gmail	Gives you structured, reliable access to all email metadata and content, including timestamps and attachments

🔧 Your Problem in Technical Terms
Right now, your dashboard likely uses polling with a third-party service (or webhook) that fetches emails and creates tickets. But the timestamp saved is probably:

new Date() → when your backend fetched the message
Instead of:

the actual Date: header from the original email

✅ Solution Steps
Switch to a proper receiving mechanism:

Use IMAP (with node-imap, imap-simple) or

Use Gmail API (recommended if you're building something Gmail-specific)

Extract the correct timestamp:

When parsing the email, extract the Date from the email headers:

js
Copy
Edit
email.headers.get('date') // or from parsed metadata
Use this date when saving the ticket to your dashboard DB, instead of using the polling time.

🛠️ Example (IMAP + mailparser in Node.js)
js
Copy
Edit
const { simpleParser } = require('mailparser');

// when you fetch the email via IMAP:
simpleParser(rawEmail, (err, parsed) => {
  const actualSendTime = parsed.date; // <-- this is what you should save
  const subject = parsed.subject;
  const from = parsed.from.text;
  const body = parsed.text;

  // Save to DB with actualSendTime
});
