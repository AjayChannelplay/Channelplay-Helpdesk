How to Fix It in Your Code
When you parse an email using something like mailparser, youâ€™ll get a field called parsed.date. This is the actual time the email was sent, which is what you want.

âœ… Step-by-Step Fix
1. Parse the Email
You likely already have something like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const { simpleParser } = require('mailparser');

const parsed = await simpleParser(imapFetchedMail);
2. Get the Actual Sent Time
js
Copy
Edit
const actualSentTime = parsed.date; // THIS is what you want
This will return a Date object like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
2025-05-22T06:35:00.000Z
3. Save It in Your Ticket
Update your DB logic to store parsed.date in your ticket model instead of new Date() or Date.now().

js
Copy
Edit
const ticket = new Ticket({
  subject: parsed.subject,
  from: parsed.from.text,
  body: parsed.text,
  htmlBody: parsed.html,
  emailSentAt: parsed.date, // âœ… Actual sent time
  createdAt: parsed.date,   // Optional: also set createdAt manually if needed
});
await ticket.save();
If youâ€™re using timestamps: true in your Mongoose schema, by default it sets createdAt to Date.now(). You can override it like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const ticket = new Ticket({
  ...,
  createdAt: parsed.date
});
await ticket.save({ timestamps: false }); // âœ… manually override createdAt
ðŸ§ª Double-Check Sample Parsed Output
Here's a sample output from mailparser:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "from": { "text": "Alice <alice@example.com>" },
  "subject": "Help needed",
  "text": "Hi, I'm stuck...",
  "date": "2025-05-22T06:35:00.000Z",
  ...
}
That "date" is the exact timestamp when the user sent the email. Thatâ€™s what should show up in your dashboard.

âœ… Final Result
Once implemented:

Dashboard will show the actual sent date/time

Not the time your poller picked up the email

Email timelines and threads will be accurate âœ…

Would you like me to help you edit your current poller code to inject this change properly into your DB layer? Just paste a snippet of your poll logic and Iâ€™ll update it for you.
