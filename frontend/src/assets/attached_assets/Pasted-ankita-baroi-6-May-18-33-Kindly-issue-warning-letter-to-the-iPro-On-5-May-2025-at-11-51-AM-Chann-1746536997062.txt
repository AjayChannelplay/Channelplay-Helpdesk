Hi Team,
This is to inform you that an iPro named
Mutum
Deepak emp code-261094 is not maintaining the store fixture hygiene.
This is to bring to your attention that despite being instructed on 22nd April 2025 to complete
the DCOTA and ensure proper store hygiene, there has been no update or action from the iPro’s
end till date. As of today, 4th May 2025, the store continues to reflect poor hygiene standards.
Additionally, we got to know that he is now raising a ticket
regarding a device issue, but he has failed to communicate or escalate
any fixture-related or store-related issues in a timely manner, despite previous reminders.
Kindly issue a show-cause notice
to the iPro regarding the
below mentioned points.
1. Negligence in maintaining
hygiene and standards at
the store.
2. Failure to provide timely
updates or escalate the fixture
issue as per protocol.
3. Delayed reporting of
device issues only after
several reminders and lapses.
